# Learning-Projects-Notebook
This repository is a curated collection of Jupyter Notebooks documenting my hands-on learning journey in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and ML Engineering. Each notebook focuses on building core concepts through real-world mini projects, experiments, and step-by-step implementations â€” from scratch to production-ready pipelines.

ðŸ“Œ Objectives

1.Learn and implement ML algorithms from scratch.

2.Understand ML workflows: data cleaning â†’ model building â†’ evaluation â†’ deployment.

3.Build end-to-end systems and pipelines for production-level understanding.

4.Apply MLOps concepts where relevant (CI/CD, reproducibility, versioning).

5.Explore research papers and reproduce core ideas in notebooks.
